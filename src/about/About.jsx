                            programming. I have professional full stack development experience working on public
                            applications for the City of Winnipeg. I am committed to writing clean production-grade code
                            and I don't shy from writing awesome documentation and solid tests. My design philosophy is
                            KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid), and so my code and designs are typically minimal.

                            experimenting in the kitchen.
